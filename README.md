Deployer
========
Deployment Tool for PHP.

Introduction
------------
There are a lot of deployment tools, even in php. But none of them are simple and functional like Deployer.

Requirements
------------
Deployer is only supported on PHP 5.3.3 and up.

Installation
------------
You can download deployer as phar archive or you can use composer:
```

Development
-----------
This project is still in development. I want to invite developers to join the development.

There are a lot of thing need to be implemented:
* Add rsync support if available.
* Add pecl ss2 extension support if available.
* Write better documentation and tests.
