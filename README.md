Introduction
------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elfet/deployer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elfet/deployer)

There are a lot of deployment tools, even in php. But none of them are simple and functional like Deployer.

Create `deploy.php` in your project:

```php
require 'recipe/symfony.php';

server('main', 'domain.com')
    ->user('you')
    ->pubKey();

server('test', 'test.domain.com')
    ->user('you');

task('deploy:done', function () {
    write('Deploy done!');
});

alter('deploy', 'deploy:done');
```

And run command:

```
dep deploy
```

Done! You just deploy your project.

Requirements
------------
Deployer is only supported on PHP 5.4.0 and up (yes, it's time to grow up).
Deployer work with ssh2 pecl extension, but if you do not install it on you machine - do not worry,
Deployer will work with [PHPSecLib](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib).
